# Gabble_Forum

## About
Hello!
I originally created this project in the summer of 2017 during a coding bootcamp!
It's now Feb 2019, and I finally decided to revisit it. I want to refactor this app,
add new features, make it responsive, and improve the design and security!

You can follow the project progress [here on this public Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ca9t9vVA/gabble).
